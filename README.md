This lab includes five Python programs that demonstrate iterative logic using loops, conditionals, and turtle graphics. Each task was completed, tested for correctness, and debugged as needed.

❗Please uncomment each section turn by turn!
✅ Deliverables:
- Problem 1 – Prints “Hello World” 100 times using a loop.
- Problem 2 – Iterates through a list of numbers:
- (a) Prints each number on a new line
- (b) Prints each number with its square
- Problem 3 – Draws a regular polygon based on user input (sides, length, line color, fill color).
- Problem 4 – Iterates numbers from 1 to 50:
- Prints messages for multiples of 3, 5, or both
- Includes a flowchart in draw.io
- Problem 5 – Creative turtle drawing using loops and color methods.
